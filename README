A simple entity component system manager with a simple example.

To use:

Subclass the Component class for components. e.g. Speed Position etc. These are for holding properties.

Subclass the System class for adding systems. e.g. Movement. This is where logic will be perfored, you'll need to override the pure update method.

Use the SystemManager to add entities. See the example code.
