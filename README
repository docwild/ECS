A simple entity component system manager with a simple example.

To use:

Subclass the Component class for components. e.g. Speed Position etc. These are for holding properties.

Subclass the System class for adding systems. e.g. Movement. This is where logic will be performed, you'll need to override the pure update method.

You'll need factory methods to provide unique_ptrs for your subclasses. Also you'll need to define the MAX constant in the ECS namespace and the ecsint type (should eb unsigned for the binary arithmetic), I need to find a better way of doing this.

Use the SystemManager to add entities. See the example code.
